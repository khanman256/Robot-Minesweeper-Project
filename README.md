The beginning of the program has the user input how many mines are on the grid. Then, the robot will go to a corner of the grid regardless of where it starts. Once the robot has gone to a corner, it will go around the outside of the grid searching for any mines. Once the robot is finished searching for mines on the outside, the robot will then search the inner lines for any mines. Whenever the robot finds a mine, it will detect that a mine was found and the robot turns around and searches for more mines. Once all the needed mines are found, the robot will perform a celebration.
